You can execute the code cell below to print out all image file names.\n","\n","To find out each image's best possible low and high threshold value, you can iteratively change the filename and try different low and high threshold values. The Canny edge results would be visualized for your reference to determine whether your entered threshold value is good or not. After you find a proper threshold value for one image, remember to fill it in `thresh_dict` dictionary for final image save."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"qAyBXQx7IhQ7","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1696024050145,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Razaq Aribidesi","userId":"01483457787930105663"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# list all image names\n","os.listdir('Images')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"hgVbhYcqIBwi","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1696024050145,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Razaq Aribidesi","userId":"01483457787930105663"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO: Change image name\n","filename = 'I1.jpg'\n","\n","# TODO: Change threshold values\n","low, high = 1, 80\n","\n","# Find tuning threshold for a single image\n","I = np.array(Image.open(os.path.join(\"Images\", filename)).convert('RGB'))\n","E = cannyEdge(I, low, high)\n","pil_image = Image.fromarray(E.astype(np.uint8) * 255).convert('L')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qPwoj3VJDnj7"},"source":["## Generate edge detection visualization for all images under `Images/` directory\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"h_MAspFDzpaN","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1696024050145,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Razaq Aribidesi","userId":"01483457787930105663"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO: Fill in the threshold (low, high) you have tuned in the cell above\n","thresh_dict = {'118035.jpg': (1, 10),\n","                '135069.jpg': (3, 30),\n","                '16068.jpg': (30, 100),\n","                '189080.jpg': (10, 40),\n","                '201080.jpg': (24, 60),\n","                '21077.jpg': (36, 80),\n","                '22013.jpg': (20, 50),\n","                '3096.jpg': (9, 25),\n","                '48017.jpg': (28, 70),\n","                '55067.jpg': (4, 10),\n","                '86000.jpg': (14, 35),\n","                'I1.jpg': (1, 2)}\n","\n","# keep results for all images\n","image_folder = \"Images\"\n","save_folder = \"Results\"\n","\n","# generate results one by one\n","for filename in os.listdir(image_folder):\n","    # read in image\n","    im_path = os.path.join(image_folder, filename)\n","    I = np.array(Image.open(im_path).convert('RGB'))\n","    low, high = thresh_dict[filename]\n","    E = cannyEdge(I, low, high)\n","    pil_image = Image.fromarray(E.astype(np.uint8) * 255).convert('L')\n","    pil_image.save(os.path.join(save_folder, \"{}_Result.png\".format(filename.split(\".\")[0])))"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"toc_visible":true,"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
